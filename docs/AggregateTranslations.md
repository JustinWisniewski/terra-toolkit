# Aggregating Translations
Terra-toolkit provides the `aggregate-translations` pre-build tool to assist with aggregating translations for internationalized terra components in a project. This tool is offered as a CLI script and as a setup function. Documentation on how to use this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit/blob/master/scripts/aggregate-translations/README.md).
